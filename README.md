This project was created by Dailynn Tejeda (djt60), Anisha Voocha(ANV106), and Samarth Bhardwaj(SAB369). 

In this repository we utilize Pandas to analyze three different datasets from the Pittsburgh WRDC website and pick the best neighborhood based on our metric, "Which Neighborhood Can You Live the Longest In?"

Dailynn's Dataset Police Indicent Blotter Dataset

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/uniform-crime-reporting-data/resource/044f2016-1dfd-4ab0-bc1e-065da05fca2e

This dataset shown from the link above analyzed data from the Police Incident Blotter Archive recorded from 2016 up until the last two months of this year. This dataset was evaluated by visualizing how many instances of crime were reported from each neighborhood with the omission of crimes that were not valuable to the data such as Public drunkenness and 99. Then the neighborhoods with the least amounts of reported crimes were put into a graph. 

Anisha's Dataset Median Age at Death 2011-15 by Municipality in Allegheny County

This dataset includes amount of black and white deaths by municipality and median age at death. This analysis creates a table that compares all these deaths within each neighborhood and identifies which neighborhood is the most suitable to live in.

Samarth's Dataset COVID-19 Vaccinations

https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-covid-19-vaccinations/resource/96cf8cdc-2b8e-43cb-b20b-443f236bcc60

This dataset contains the number of partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated, and fully vaccinated individuals with booster shots by each neighborhood in pittsburgh. To conduct the proper analysis, the ratio of each population of people that had booster shots was calculated and the neighborhood with the highest rate was determined.
