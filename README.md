Dailynn's Police Indicent Blotter Dataset

This dataset shown from the link above analyzed data from the Police Incident Blotter Archive recorded from 2016 up until the last two months of this year. This dataset was evaluated by visualizing how many instances of crime were reported from each neighborhood with the omission of crimes that were not valuable to the data such as Public drunkenness and 99.
